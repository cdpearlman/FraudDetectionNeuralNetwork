Summary: 
This comprehensive case study on credit card fraud delves into diverse methodologies for
data preprocessing, analysis, and predictive modeling. Leveraging a synthetic credit card fraud
dataset sourced from Kaggle, the investigation began with feature selection and data cleansing to
enhance usability. Then an array of supervised learning approaches, including support vector
machines, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors is explored. Augmenting these techniques
with advanced data processing methods such as principal component analysis and normalization,
refined the selected models. Ultimately, utilizing a neural network bolstered by these
preprocessing techniques, obtaining the highest predictive accuracy with an F1 score of 0.79,
marking a significant milestone in fraud detection

Notes:
The code is somewhat sparratic, as we used it more to generate visualizations and test predictive models than as a submission.
